An (un?)opinionated Sequelize model and association builder. You give us just the Sequelize objects/tables you want, we give you production ready JavaScript files implementing your sequlize models to use in your projects.

This package can be used either as a dependency in another project, command line tool, or with lazyBuilder (our GUI).
