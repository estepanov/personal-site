This website!

Static site generation is what all the cool kids are talking about today.
My previous personal site was a boring old [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and it needed an upgrade.
This is a full stack typescript application.
The front end is powered by Gatsby hosted on Netlify and the back end is powered by Serverless hosted on AWS.

Styled this new project using [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com) and I highly recommend it.
Theme-ui follows constraint-based design principals and enables building themeable user interfaces

One of the coolest parts of building this site in Gatsby, is that I can have simple markdown or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) for all my content.
Gatsby then generates React pages dynamically.

Some features:
- custom Github commit history chart to landing page
