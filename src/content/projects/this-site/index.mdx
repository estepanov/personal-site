This website!

Static site generation is what all the cool kids are talking about today.
My previous personal site was a boring old create-react-app and it needed an upgrage.
Styled this new project using [theme-ui](https://theme-ui.com) and I highly recommend it.

One of the coolest parts of building this site in Gatsby, is that I can have simple markdown or [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) for all my content.
It maybe out there, but I also imagine a setup where this site can simultaniously pump out a generated PDF resume.
