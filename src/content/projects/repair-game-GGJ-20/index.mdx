Grandma's electronics are broken! Compete against your siblings in a race to fix grandma's electronics.
All players join a lobby and can start a three round game. Gain points for droping circuits into the corresponding slots.

I mostly built the backend, client-server communications, and server managed game state on clients.

A submission made to the [Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org) 2020.
This was a friday through sunday spent working with a small cross functional team consisting of cool developers, designers, and musicians.



#### Frontend

A create-react-app with that connects using [feathers](https://feathersjs.com) client and [socket.io](https://socket.io) to communicate
with a server.

#### Backend

The backend is Node based utilizing [feathers](https://feathersjs.com).
There is a single lobby for all connections to join. Once they join the server maintains game state and keeps it synchronized across clients.
