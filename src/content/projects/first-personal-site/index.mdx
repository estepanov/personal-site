My very first personal website. Bootstrapped this thing with create-react-app and went along with vanilla CSS3 modules. This project was about simplicity.
Contact form was powered by an email sent from serverless function deployed on Azure, with the frontend deployed with Netlify. Projects had simple pages with click able tags.s
