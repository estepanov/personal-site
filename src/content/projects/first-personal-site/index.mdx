My very first personal website. Bootstrapped this thing with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and went along with vanilla CSS3 modules.

This project was all about simplicity, with simple CSS and create-react-app.
A clean landing page, a list of my projects, and a contact form.
The project list had a tag cloud and selecting a tag would show projects that applied to the tag.
The contact form was powered by an email sent from serverless function deployed on Azure.

One thing I did not like about this project was the lack of SSR support.
Create-react-app is great for getting something up quickly, but ejecting the application and taking over the configuration isn't that fun.

The frontend deployed with Netlify.
