My very first personal website. Bootstrapped this thing with create-react-app and went along with vanilla CSS3 modules.

This project was about simplicity with simple CSS and create react app. The contact form was powered by an email sent from serverless function deployed on Azure.

The frontend deployed with Netlify. Each project had a simple page with tagss that can be clicked to show projects using tag.
